It takes a broad view of Information Security and Privacy and covers the essential principles for the protection of information systems; the relevant technologies; organizational concerns; policies, human aspects; legal approaches; criminology; and ethical issues. Students will gain an appreciation for the difficulty of designing, developing, deploying and maintaining information systems, services and software products that are secure and comply with expectations of security and privacy. "
IS490,Advanced Topics in Information Studies ,"Directed and supervised investigation of selected topics in information studies that may include among others the social, political,
and historical contexts of information creation and dissemination; computers and culture; information policy; community information systems; production, retrieval and evaluation of knowledge; computer-mediated communication"
IS501,Information Organization and Access,"Emphasizes information organization and access in settings and systems of different kinds. Traces the information transfer process from the generation of knowledge through its storage and use in both print and non-print formats. Consideration will be given to the creation of information systems: the principles and practice of selection and preservation, methods of organizing information for retrieval and display, the operation of organizations that provide information services, and the information service needs of various user communities "

As an experiential learning class, this course covers advanced techniques of business research with an emphasis on managing real-world client projects. Students will be assigned to teams and work with clients to identify research requirements and construct recommendations. Students will acquire critical skills in creating professional deliverables through client engagements. Students will build professional research portfolios at the conclusion of their projects. Course Information: 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. May be repeated in separate terms up to 8 hours if topics vary. Prerequisite: Instructor approval required."
IS542A,"DATa, Stat, Info","This is a required course for the MSIM degree. An introduction to statistical and probabilistic models as they pertain to quantifying information, assessing information quality, and principled application of information to decision making, with focus on model selection and gauging model quality. The course reviews relevant results from probability theory, parametric and non-parametric predictive models, as well as extensions of these models for unsupervised learning. Applications of statistical and probabilistic models to tasks in information management (e.g. prediction, ranking, and data reduction) are emphasized. Course Information: 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Prerequisite: Graduate standing."

IS590DT,Data Mining,"Data mining refers to the process of exploring large datasets with the goal of uncovering interesting patterns. This process usually involves a number of tasks such as data collection, pre-processing, and characterization; model fitting, selection, and evaluation; classification, clustering, and prediction. Although data mining has its roots in database management, it has grown into a discipline that focuses on algorithm design (to ensure computational feasibility) and statistical modeling (to separate the signal from the noise). It draws heavily upon a variety of other disciplines including statistics, machine learning, operations research, and information retrieval. Will cover the major data mining concepts, principles, and techniques that *every information scientist should know about.* Lectures will introduce and discuss the major approaches to data mining; computer lab sessions coupled with assignments will provide hands-on experience with these approaches; term projects offer the Variety of newly developed and special topics courses on different aspects of the information sciences intended to augment the existing curriculum, offered as sections of IS 590. Course Information: Additional fees may apply. See Class Schedule. 1 to 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. May be repeated.
